                    <p>APIs You Won't Hate is a resource for developers who want to learn how to build APIs that are
                      secure, performant, and easy to use. I've been helping to run and maintain the site since roughly
                      the beginning of 2018, when I rebuilt it from a Jekyll site to a static site with Gatsby. This was
                      a huge leap forward for the site - as we were growing the community and adding resources for API
                      developers regularly, it became apparent that we were going to need to support some features that
                      I wasn't really interested in building on top of Jekyll - support for multiple authors, an image
                      optimzation solution.</p>
                    <h4>Why we chose to move away from Gatsby</h4>
                    <p>So, I built the site with Gatsby, as a visual clone of the Jekyll site. It worked fantastically
                      for us, but as we added more and more articles and authors to the site, it became challenging to
                      maintain, for a variety of reasons.
                    </p>
                    <p>- Building the site was slow</p>
                    <p>From a clean cache, it could take from 11-15 minutes to build, which meant that regular
                      deployments to our hosting provider were starting to get expensive. It also meant that any debug
                      tasks which required a production build were intolerably slow, and very frustrating.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>- Dealing with images was challenging</p>
                  <p>Gatsby has an amazingly clever strategy for image optimization, which involves sending all images
                    used on the site through a pre-build pipeline that makes them accessible via Gatsby's graphql API.
                    This is a foundational part of how Gatsby sites are meant to run, and it gives plenty of options for
                    image loading strategies and optimization approaches.<br>

                    What we never quite got right with our implementation was a strategy that would allow authors to
                    upload images to the apisyouwonthate.com repo with a naming strategy that was sensible.<br>

                    Essentially, due to a quirk in our chosen implementation, each image on the site had to have a
                    unique name, and if two images with the same name were uploaded, it caused all kinds of problems.
                    You can imagine that in the course of writing dozens of articles about APIs, there's more than one
                    occasion to create an image called devtools-network-tab.png, or cover.png, etc.</p>
                  <p>- Updating the site required too much understanding of Gatsby's underlying platform</p>
                  <p>This basically meant that of the three of us who maintain the site, I was the only one equipped to
                    make significant changes, because I had spent a good deal of time in my day-to-day job building
                    prototypes with Gatsby for Gymnasium. When either of my teammates wanted to make changes to the
                    site, they had a choice: spend hours and hours trying to figure out how the site was configured,
                    struggle to make changes, and submit a PR, or create an issue on GitHub and assign it to me to fix.
                    You can probably guess which happened more often - and looking back, it makes total sense.</p>
                  <p>- Some lugnut* had used boostrap to design the layout for the site</p>
                  <p>I used bootstrap out of convenience, and hamfisted it into working with our React site using a
                    couple of libraries and band-aids to get it all "working" properly. This resulted in a
                    near-infinite supply of teeny tiny little layout bugs. These would be fantastic if I needed them
                    for job security... but in practice they were relentless headaches.</p>
                  <h4>So, what did we gain from moving to Next.js?</h4>
                  <p>Let me be the first to tell you that it's highly likely that everything I accomplished in the
                    site rebuild with Next.js is possible with Gatsby (or your favorite framework). This rebuild
                    sets the stage for a number of features to come, and should make it easier for us to collaborate
                    with new authors, iterate on site designs, and add small features without having to suffer a 10+
                    minute CI process.
                    This rebuild gave me a chance to add features, and add some meaningful updates which had been on
                    my plate for quite a long time. Here's a quick summary of some of my favorite features of the
                    new site:</p>
                  <h4>SEO features</h4>
                  <p>For the first time ever, Open Graph Images are embedded correctly across the site - the site uses a
                    fairly simple strategy, grabbing a predetermined cover image of just-the-right-size and embedding
                    that in the header of each page using Open Graph metadata.</p>
                  <div class=" text-center animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-2s">
                    <img src="assets/images/blog/og-embeds-work copia.png" alt="new blog" class="blog-img ">
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p>We've also got fairly fine-grained control of other SEO metadata, including author names, article
                    titles, and descriptions. Our new implementation will allow us to set Canonical URLs for articles
                    crossposted to APIs You Won't Hate from other sources as well, which makes for better SEO all
                    around. This may also help down the line if we want to add sponsored posts to the site which point
                    to another origin as the canonical home for the information we share.</p>
                  <h4>Contact form & Newsletter signup</h4>
                  <p>We had previously been using Netlify Forms for the site's contact form, but since the new site is
                    hosted on Vercel, that is no longer possible. We're now using Airtable's API for the form, which
                    lets us collate all submissions into one place. New entries to this form trigger a routine which
                    notifies site owners that we got a message. We then use Airtable to track responses, and make sure
                    that nothing gets lost in the mail.</p>
                  <h4>Lighthouse scores</h4>
                  <p>Our Lighthouse scores shot up with this reimplementation - and while they're a moving target for
                    a variety of reasons, performance on the site is generally really great. This is helped immensely
                    by Next.js's Image component, which uses a variety of web standards and recommended practices to
                    load the right-size image depending on readers' given device and browser.</p>
                  <div class=" text-center animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-2s">
                    <img src="assets/images/blog/lighthouse-scores copia.png" alt="new blog" class="blog-img ">
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Search Performance</h4>
                  <p>One of the most important litmus tests available for our site's general performance comes from
                    Google's Search Console. Thankfully, since the site was deployed, we've seen consistent traffic on
                    across all of our pages, with a slight-but-steady increase week to week:</p>
                  <div class=" text-center animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__delay-2s">
                    <img src="assets/images/blog/search-results copia.png" alt="new blog" class="blog-img ">
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <p>Next also made it far easier to generate a sitemap.xml for APIs You Won't Hate. In Gatsbyland, we
                    needed to use gatsby-plugin-sitemap, which is configurable, but is generated at build time. This
                    meant that debugging sitemap changes took a full 10min+ for each change - which was completely
                    untenable for us.</p>
                  <p>By contrast, our sitemap implementation with Next.js uses a library called next-sitemap. It is also
                    generated at build time, but in a local dev environment builds take only a few seconds, allowing me
                    to nail our sitemap much more quickly.</p>
